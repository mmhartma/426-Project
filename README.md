Writeup: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lC1aXTUgoB7zwYCiazCo7pRCKT__fCV9PVHPbxPWtPU/edit?usp=sharing

## To Deploy:

1. npx hardhat compile

2. npx hardhat node

3. Open a new console

4. In the root directory of the project: npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/PwMD.js --network localhost

5. Copy the address under "Deployed Address", paste in src/App.js "CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

6. npm start







report: 
This Solidity smart contract implements the ERC-721 standard so that we can create, move, and monitor the other NFTs. Also, provides the On-chain password locker. NFT holders can add, view, modify, or delete encrypted passwords tied to any website URL and username. Each password is secured by a key derived from the tokenâ€™s ID, the URL and the username via keccak256. OnlyOwner guard guarantee that only token owner can manage the password. Encrypted data and initialization vectors are stored in a map to keep the cost of gas fee low. Transfer, Approval, ApprovalForALL, these are the standard events that runs automatically so marketplaces and indexers can track activity. Minting works at a set price and supply cap to keep tokens rare and tokenomics predictable. To emphasize the security, zero-address transfers and unauthorized calls are rejected. By dividing responsibilities and minizing the On-chain storage, this design opens the road for a simple, efficient decentralized identity and credential system. 

Tech Stack Summary:
-	Solidity 0.8.20 compiler
-	Hardhat framework
-	Ethereum Virtual machine 
-	Keccak256: hashing for key derivation
-	ON-chain mapping structure for encrypted data and IV storage
-	Standard ERC165/IERC721 interfaces

Key Feature:
-	ERC721 minting, balance tracking, ownership transfer
-	onlyOwner modifier for robust access control
-	On-chain storage of encrypted credentials
-	Collision-resistant key derivation via keccak256()
-	Emission of standard NFT events for off-chain indexing
